Presentation, Evaluation and attempt at improving GENIE3. Some University homework

Original GENIE3 code : https://github.com/vahuynh/GENIE3
Original Research Paper : Huynh-Thu V. A., Irrthum A., Wehenkel L., and Geurts P.
Inferring regulatory networks from expression data using tree-based methods.
PLoS ONE, 5(9):e12776, 2019.


## Methodology:

### Use the code to generate the results:


#### Prerequisites:

You need to install the following packages:

* sklearn
* python-igraph 
* matplotlib
* plotly
* grenadine

#### Folder structure:

The notebook is called Experimenting_with_genie3 and is located in the GENIE3/script/notebook/ folder
The report is directly available on GENIE3/ folder


  **Warning**

 </span> Multiple cells generate results and write files to compute the plots. These files are already generated, and launching these, is not useful and very time consuming.

## Structure of the repository:


* dream_data: DREAM4 in sillico challence data, used for the analysis (taken from the synapse website)
* figures: Figures generated by the notebook
* generated_data: data generated by the python script for the plotting of the various curves 
* lib : libraries used for the notebook
* references: research papers links and project rules
* scripts/notebook: jupyter notebook code
